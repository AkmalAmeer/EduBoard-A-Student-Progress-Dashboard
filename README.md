EduBoard – A Student Progress Dashboard
Objective:
Design and build a fully responsive student dashboard UI using HTML and CSS. The dashboard will simulate a real educational portal that displays a student's academic data like grades, attendance, progress, deadlines, and personal information.

Tasks:
1. Layout Structure
Create a multi-section dashboard page using semantic HTML elements:


Sidebar navigation


Top navbar (header)


Main content area with cards and tables


2. Design Sections
Sidebar Navigation


Links: Dashboard, Subjects, Attendance, Profile, Settings
Navigation to the links is optional


Header Section


Student profile name, avatar, notifications icon (using placeholder or Font Awesome)


Student Overview Cards


Cards showing GPA, Attendance %, Assignments Due, Total Credits


Progress Table


Table listing each subject with progress bars for completion %


Upcoming Deadlines Section


List with styled date badges and assignment details


Student Profile Info


Responsive profile card with details like:


Name, Roll No, Email, College, Department


3. Styling
Use Flexbox and/or Grid for layout structuring


Apply consistent spacing, padding, and shadows


Style progress bars and badges using CSS only


Implement responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens


Use a clean color palette (blues, whites, greys, or pastel themes)


4. Accessibility & Semantics
Use semantic tags `(<nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>)`


Ensure good color contrast and readable font sizes


Alt attributes for images and icons
Evaluation Criteria:
Ensure all major sections like sidebar, header, progress cards, deadlines, and profile info are implemented as per the objectives.
Use clean and consistent CSS styling including proper use of colors, fonts, spacing, and shadows for a modern UI feel.
The layout should adapt well to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile) using media queries or responsive units.
Use appropriate semantic tags (like ` <nav>, <section>, <header>, <article> `) and ensure the HTML is properly indented and structured.
